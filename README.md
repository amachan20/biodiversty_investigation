# Biodiversity_Analysis

This project is intended to carry out species analysis in 4 national parks located in the United States. The investigation is carried out to see which species are at the threshold of each conservation status. This analysis is intended to provide a list of which species must be carefully monitored to prevent significant species decline and to maintain their sustainability.
